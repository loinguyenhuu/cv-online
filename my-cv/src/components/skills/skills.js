          Hi, I'm Pham Van Khanh, a Front-end developer with 3 years of
          experience.
          <br />
          My main skills: ReactJS, Mobile-First Web Design
          <br />
          I especially like learning JavaScript (and it's libraries), TypeScript,
          finding ways to optimize and increase performance
          <br />
          I like (deep) talking and chilling with other people. I was excited by
          the colorful things.
          <br />
          My hobbies: reading, playing guitar, singing (but not really good)...
